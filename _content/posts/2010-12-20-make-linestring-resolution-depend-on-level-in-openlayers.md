So, you want to render a route on your OpenLayers map. Everything will be nice and sweet until youâ€™ll have to render a huge route, in which case no matter what computer your clients have, most probably it will stall. To solve this you have two possibilities: you either reduce the number of lines you send from the server or you reduce the number of points rendered directly on the clientâ€™s browser.

Both solutions will raise a problem: if the user will zoom deep enough, they will see a discrepancy between the route and the road (the number of points in the route will not equal the number of points on the road). So, the road may do a turn where your route plotting will just cut the corner. To solve this, I found a very adaptive solution that will reduce the number of points in your route the further you zoom out.

The solution is to create a custom renderer. In the following example, it is shown how to override the default behavior for the SVG renderer, but you can implement it also for another renderer if required.

```js
OpenLayers.Renderer.Smart = OpenLayers.Class(OpenLayers.Renderer.SVG, {

    getComponentsString: function(components, separator)
    {
        var zoomFactors = new Array();
        // 0 is a mandatory key
        zoomFactors[0] = 1000;
        zoomFactors[1] = 500;
        zoomFactors[2] = 400;
        zoomFactors[3] = 300;
        zoomFactors[4] = 200;
        zoomFactors[5] = 100;
        zoomFactors[6] = 50;
        zoomFactors[7] = 10;
        zoomFactors[9] = 1;

        var zoomIndex = this.map.zoom;
        var zoomFactor = zoomFactors[zoomIndex];

        // see comment above the zoomFactors array
        while (zoomFactor == undefined)
        {
            zoomIndex--;
            zoomFactor = zoomFactors[zoomIndex];
        }

        var renderCmp = [];
        var complete = true;
        var len = components.length;
        var strings = [];
        var str, component;

        // here is where we plug in the zoomFactor in the original code
        // so instead of rendering each and every point, we will skip n number of
        // points, based on the 'zoomFactors' array

        for(var i=0; i<len; i+=zoomFactor) {
            component = components[i];
            renderCmp.push(component);
            str = this.getShortString(component);
            if (str) {
                strings.push(str);
            } else {
                if (i > 0) {
                    if (this.getShortString(components[i - 1])) {
                        strings.push(this.clipLine(components[i],
                            components[i-1]));
                    }
                }
                if (i < len - 1) {
                    if (this.getShortString(components[i + 1])) {
                        strings.push(this.clipLine(components[i],
                            components[i+1]));
                    }
                }
                complete = false;
            }
        }

        return {
            path: strings.join(separator || ","),
            complete: complete
        };
    },

    CLASS_NAME: "OpenLayers.Renderer.Smart"
});
```

The way I determine by how much to reduce the number of points based on the zoom is simple: I just have an array of zoom factors. If the user zoom to level `x` it just looks which is the closest value to `x` defined in my array.

Ok, so after youâ€™ve defined your new renderer, itâ€™s time to use it on your map. The way to do this is to add it to your vector layer that you use to render your route like so:

```js
routeLayer = new OpenLayers.Layer.Vector("Vectors", {
   renderers: ['Smart', 'VML', 'Canvas']
});
```

You just have to add the name of your render class as a string. The default list of renderers where `['SVG', 'VML', 'Canvas']`. So you noticed how Iâ€™ve changed only the SVG with my renderer. That is because browsers like Internet Explorer do not support SVG. This way, if OpenLayers sees that it can not use our `Smart` renderer, it will proceed with the next one in the list until it finds one that it can use.

Of course, if the browser will use `VML` or `Canvas`, youâ€™ll have again this problem, so you may want to implement this solution also for the other renderers. I suspect itâ€™s just a matter of changing the class your renderer extends, but I didnâ€™t try it yet.

Hope it helps ðŸ˜‰
