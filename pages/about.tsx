# Hello friend ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nicu Surdu. I'm a software engineer by day, and a
tinkerer by night. I enjoy writing good software for good people and
using my free time to build and play with gadgets.

From time to time I like to contribute to my or other's open source
projects. You can find them all on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/surdu)
or take a look on the [Projects](/projects) page, where I've picked my best ones.

You can contact me using the [contact form](/contact).
